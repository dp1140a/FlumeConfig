The implementation only counts the Event body, which is the reason for providing the byteCapacityBufferPercentage configuration parameter as well. Defaults to a computed value equal to 80% of the maximum memory available to the JVM (i.e. 80% of the -Xmx value passed on the command line). Note that if you have multiple memory channels on a single JVM, and they happen to hold the same physical events (i.e. if you are using a replicating channel selector from a single source) then those event sizes may be double-counted for channel byteCapacity purposes. Setting this value to 0 will cause this value to fall back to a hard internal limit of about 200 GB."
